<structure>
entities:
  - id: char_001
    type: character

    name: Character Name
    description: Brief description
    existing: false
    properties: {}
relationships:
  - type: visits
    subject: char_001
    object: loc_001
    location: null
    metadata: {}
driving_entities:
  - char_001
  - item_001
  - item_004
location_progression:
  - location_001
  - location_003
  - location_002
</structure>
Entity types: character, location, item
Character subtypes: protagonist, antagonist, supporting, animal
Location subtypes: interior, exterior, magical, real
Item subtypes: key-item, tool, treasure

Relationship types: visits, finds, creates, owns, meets, helps, fights, etc.

Driving Entities: characters and items that move the story forward. For characters, usually the protagonist or a main supporting character. For items, it's a key-item or tool that is needed to proceed. It doesn't have to be a literal key.

Story input: "{{input_text#The original story input text from the user}}"

Extract all mentioned characters, locations, items, and their relationships. Mark entities as existing=false for now (LightRAG integration will be added later).
