# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Create a controlled, personalized bedtime story generation system that allows parent-child collaboration
- Maintain narrative consistency through a reusable world of characters and locations
- Provide human checkpoints to prevent AI hallucinations and ensure age-appropriate content
- Build a cost-effective solution that grows with the child's imagination
- Enable story customization for tone, length, morals, and complexity

## Background Context

Current AI story generation tools lack two critical features: consistent world-building across multiple stories and sufficient human control points to ensure appropriate content. This tool addresses these gaps through a 3-stage pipeline (context → outline → story) that allows intervention at each stage, combined with a knowledge base (LightRAG API) that provides existing character and location information for reference. The system uses file-based templates for extensibility without code changes, making it adaptable as storytelling needs evolve.

**Data Entry Process:** The LightRAG API is populated manually after stories are read, not during generation. When generating a new story, the system queries the LightRAG API to find existing characters and locations, then creates new entities in the context file for any characters/locations not found. After the story is complete and read, parents can manually add new characters and locations to the LightRAG API for future stories.
