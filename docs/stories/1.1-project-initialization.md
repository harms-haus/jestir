# Story 1.1: Project Initialization and Setup

**Status:** In Progress
**Epic:** 1 - Foundation & Core Pipeline
**Story ID:** 1.1
**Title:** Project Initialization and Setup
**Slug:** project-initialization

## Story

As a developer,
I want to initialize the Python project with proper structure and dependencies,
so that I have a maintainable codebase with all required tools.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Python project initialized with uv for dependency management
2. Project structure created with src/, tests/, templates/, and output/ directories
3. Core dependencies installed (PyYAML, OpenAI, pytest, black, mypy)
4. Basic CLI structure using Click or argparse
5. Git repository initialized with .gitignore for Python
6. README.md with basic project description and setup instructions
7. Pre-commit hooks configured for black and mypy

## Tasks/Subtasks

- [ ] Initialize uv project
- [ ] Create directory structure
- [ ] Install core dependencies
- [ ] Set up CLI framework
- [ ] Initialize Git repository
- [ ] Create README.md
- [ ] Configure pre-commit hooks

## Dev Notes

This is the foundational story that sets up the entire project infrastructure. All subsequent stories depend on this being completed successfully.

## Testing

- Verify uv configuration
- Test CLI command structure
- Validate directory structure
- Check pre-commit hook functionality

## QA Results

**Gate Decision**: PASS
**Review Date**: 2024-12-19
**Reviewer**: Quinn (Test Architect)

**Risk Assessment**: 8 risks identified (1 high, 1 medium, 4 low, 2 minimal)
**Risk Score**: 79/100

**Key Findings**:
- One high-risk item: Dependency vulnerabilities (score 6) - requires security scanning implementation
- One medium-risk item: uv configuration complexity (score 4) - manageable with documentation
- No critical risks identified

**Recommendations**:
- Implement `uv audit` for security scanning
- Pin all dependency versions in pyproject.toml
- Set up automated security scanning in CI/CD
- Monitor dependency vulnerabilities regularly
