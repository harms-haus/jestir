# Story 3.3: Story Length Control

**Status:** Pending
**Epic:** 3 - Advanced Features & Optimization
**Story ID:** 3.3
**Title:** Story Length Control
**Slug:** story-length-control

## Story

As a parent,
I want to specify desired story length,
so that I can match stories to available reading time.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Length specification in context settings (word count or reading time)
2. Outline generation respects length constraints
3. Story generation adheres to target length (Â±10%)
4. Command flag `--length 500` or `--time 5`
5. Length validation before generation
6. Automatic adjustment suggestions if outline too long/short

## Tasks/Subtasks

- [ ] Add length specification to context settings
- [ ] Implement length constraints in outline generation
- [ ] Add length control to story generation
- [ ] Create command line flags for length
- [ ] Add length validation system
- [ ] Implement adjustment suggestions
- [ ] Add reading time calculations
- [ ] Create length optimization algorithms
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing

## Dev Notes

This story adds length control capabilities to ensure stories match the desired reading time. It affects both outline and story generation stages, requiring coordination between the two. Length can be specified as word count or reading time in minutes.

## Testing

- Test length specification in context settings
- Test outline generation with length constraints
- Test story generation length adherence
- Test command line flag functionality
- Test length validation accuracy
- Test adjustment suggestions
- Test reading time calculations
- Test optimization algorithms

## QA Results

**Gate Decision**: CONCERNS
**Review Date**: 2024-12-19
**Reviewer**: Quinn (Test Architect)

**Risk Assessment**: 8 risks identified (2 high, 4 medium, 2 low)
**Risk Score**: 78/100

**Key Findings**:
- High risk in length constraint integration complexity requiring careful implementation
- Performance impact from additional token usage needs monitoring
- User expectation management critical for feature success
- Integration testing essential for outline-to-story length consistency

**Recommendations**:
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- Add comprehensive performance monitoring
- Create user education materials
- Conduct extensive integration testing
