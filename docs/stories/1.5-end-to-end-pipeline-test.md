# Story 1.5: End-to-End Pipeline Test

**Status:** Pending
**Epic:** 1 - Foundation & Core Pipeline
**Story ID:** 1.5
**Title:** End-to-End Pipeline Test
**Slug:** end-to-end-pipeline-test

## Story

As a developer,
I want to test the complete pipeline from input to story,
so that I can verify the system works as designed.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Integration test runs all three stages sequentially
2. Test covers entity extraction and relationship parsing using OpenAI AI
3. Mock OpenAI responses for consistent testing
4. Verify file outputs at each stage
5. Validate context.yaml maintains complete history
6. Test parallel story generation with different filenames

## Tasks/Subtasks

- [ ] Create integration test framework
- [ ] Implement end-to-end test scenarios
- [ ] Set up mock OpenAI responses
- [ ] Test all three pipeline stages
- [ ] Verify file output validation
- [ ] Test context file history maintenance
- [ ] Add parallel story generation tests
- [ ] Create test data fixtures
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking

## Dev Notes

This is the validation story for Epic 1, ensuring the complete pipeline works correctly. It depends on all previous Epic 1 stories (1.1-1.4) being completed and provides confidence that the foundation is solid.

## Testing

- Test complete pipeline with various inputs
- Verify all file outputs are created correctly
- Test context file history preservation
- Validate parallel processing capabilities
- Test error handling across pipeline stages
- Verify mock responses work consistently
- Test performance with different input sizes
