# Story 3.5: Batch Operations Support

**Status:** Pending
**Epic:** 3 - Advanced Features & Optimization
**Story ID:** 3.5
**Title:** Batch Operations Support
**Slug:** batch-operations-support

## Story

As a parent,
I want to process multiple story variations efficiently,
so that I can explore different story directions.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Command `jestir batch --variations 3` generates multiple outlines
2. Parallel processing for independent operations
3. Variation parameters (tone, length, moral emphasis)
4. Results comparison in markdown table
5. Selection command to choose preferred variation
6. Token usage optimization for batches

## Tasks/Subtasks

- [ ] Implement batch command functionality
- [ ] Add parallel processing support
- [ ] Create variation parameter system
- [ ] Implement results comparison
- [ ] Add selection command
- [ ] Optimize token usage for batches
- [ ] Create batch progress tracking
- [ ] Add batch result management
- [ ] Create comprehensive testing

## Dev Notes

This story adds batch processing capabilities for generating multiple story variations efficiently. It enables users to explore different story directions and choose the best option. Parallel processing and token optimization are key features for performance.

## Testing

- Test batch command with various parameters
- Test parallel processing functionality
- Test variation parameter system
- Test results comparison accuracy
- Test selection command
- Test token usage optimization
- Test progress tracking
- Test batch result management

## QA Results

**Gate Decision**: CONCERNS
**Review Date**: 2024-12-19
**Reviewer**: Quinn (Test Architect)

**Risk Assessment**: 12 risks identified (0 critical, 3 high, 6 medium, 3 low)
**Risk Score**: 72/100 (Medium Risk)

**Key Findings**:
- Parallel processing implementation complexity requires careful async/await patterns
- Resource exhaustion risk with large batch sizes needs monitoring and limits
- File management conflicts in parallel operations require unique naming and atomic operations
- CLI command interface design complexity needs intuitive structure and examples
- Token usage optimization can leverage existing TokenTracker infrastructure

**Recommendations**:
- Start with sequential processing implementation, add parallel processing incrementally
- Implement comprehensive error handling and cleanup mechanisms
- Use unique file naming and atomic operations for parallel file management
- Design clear CLI command structure with comprehensive help and examples
- Add resource monitoring and batch size limits
