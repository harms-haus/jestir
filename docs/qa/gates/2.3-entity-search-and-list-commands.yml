# Notes
notes: |
  Story 2.3 has a moderate risk profile with no critical risks identified. The CLI commands
  are already implemented and functional, with good mock mode support and error handling.
  The main concerns are around performance with large datasets and input validation.
  With proper testing and minor improvements, this story can be safely deployed.

  The existing implementation demonstrates good architecture and error handling practices.
  The risk score of 78/100 indicates a relatively low-risk implementation that should
  proceed with standard testing and monitoring practices.
