    title: 'LightRAG API dependency and availability'
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - 'Implement robust fallback to mock mode when API unavailable'
      - 'Add circuit breaker pattern for API calls'
      - 'Provide clear user messaging about API dependency'
      - 'Cache validation results to reduce API dependency'
    monitor:
      - 'Add performance metrics for validation speed'
      - 'Add API metrics for LightRAG integration success rates'

# Gate Decision
gate_decision:
  status: "CONCERNS"
  rationale: |
    Story 2.4 has one critical risk (TECH-001) around LightRAG API dependency that must be addressed before deployment.
    The validation functionality is well-architected with comprehensive test coverage, but the external API dependency
    creates a single point of failure. With proper mitigation strategies implemented, this story can proceed with
    acceptable risk levels.

  conditions:
    - "Critical risk TECH-001 must be mitigated before deployment"
    - "High risks TECH-002, TECH-003, DATA-001 require comprehensive testing"
    - "Medium risks can be managed with proper monitoring"
    - "Low risks are acceptable for deployment"

# Requirements Traceability
requirements_coverage:
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Command `jestir validate context.yaml` checks structure - COVERED"
    - "Verify all entity references exist in LightRAG API - COVERED with risk TECH-001"
    - "Check relationship consistency - COVERED with risk TECH-002"
    - "Validate required settings are present - COVERED with risk TECH-003"
    - "Warning for unusual patterns - COVERED with risk TECH-002"
    - "Clear error messages with fix suggestions - COVERED with risk OPS-001"
