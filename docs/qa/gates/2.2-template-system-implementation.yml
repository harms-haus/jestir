# Gate Decision Rationale
gate_rationale: |
  The template system implementation has moderate risk with two high-priority security concerns that must be addressed before production deployment.

  Key concerns:
  - Path traversal vulnerability (SEC-001) - Critical security issue requiring immediate attention
  - Template injection risk (SEC-002) - High security risk requiring proper escaping
  - Template validation gaps (BUS-001) - Medium risk affecting user experience
  - Cache management issues (OPS-001, OPS-002) - Medium operational risks

  The gate decision is CONCERNS due to the presence of high-risk security issues that must be mitigated before production deployment.
