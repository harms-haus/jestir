    title: 'API interface design complexity'
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - 'Design comprehensive API interface with proper method signatures'
      - 'Implement robust async operation state management'
      - 'Add comprehensive unit tests for all API methods'
    monitor:
      - 'Monitor session management for race conditions'
      - 'Track API performance under concurrent load'
      - 'Validate error response consistency across all methods'

quality_analysis:
  requirements_coverage: "Good"
  testability: "High"
  maintainability: "Medium"
  security_considerations: "Medium"
  performance_considerations: "Medium"

  key_findings:
    - "API interface design requires careful planning to maintain CLI compatibility"
    - "Async operations need robust state management and cleanup"
    - "Session management must handle concurrent operations safely"
    - "Error handling needs consistent structure across all API methods"
    - "Performance testing required for concurrent request handling"

  concerns:
    - "High complexity in mapping CLI functionality to clean API interface"
    - "Async operation state management could lead to resource leaks"
    - "Session management race conditions need careful handling"
    - "Error response consistency across all API methods"
    - "Concurrent request handling performance impact"

  recommendations:
    - "Design API interface first with comprehensive documentation"
    - "Implement proper async/await patterns with state tracking"
    - "Add session isolation and proper cleanup mechanisms"
    - "Define standard error response format and implement consistently"
    - "Add comprehensive load testing for concurrent operations"
    - "Implement proper authentication and authorization for API access"

testing_strategy:
  unit_tests:
    - "All API method signatures and parameter validation"
    - "Async operation lifecycle and state management"
    - "Error handling and response formatting"
    - "Session management and cleanup"

  integration_tests:
    - "API integration with existing CLI components"
    - "Concurrent session handling"
    - "Error propagation from underlying services"
    - "Progress callback accuracy and timing"

  performance_tests:
    - "Load testing with multiple concurrent API calls"
    - "Memory usage during long-running operations"
    - "Response times under various load conditions"
    - "Resource cleanup and leak detection"

  security_tests:
    - "API authentication and authorization"
    - "Session token security and validation"
    - "Input validation and sanitization"
    - "Access control and rate limiting"

gate_decision:
  status: "CONCERNS"
  rationale: "Story has medium risk level with 2 high-risk items that need attention before production. API interface design complexity and async operation state management require careful implementation and comprehensive testing."

    - "Async operations properly implemented with state management"
    - "Session management handles concurrent operations safely"
    - "Error handling implemented consistently across all methods"
    - "Comprehensive unit and integration tests implemented"
    - "Performance testing completed for concurrent operations"
    - "Security testing completed for authentication and authorization"
