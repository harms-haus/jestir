### Accepted Risks

- None at this time

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Error rates**: API failure rates and fallback to mock mode
- **User behavior**: Search query patterns and result set sizes
- **Resource usage**: Memory and CPU usage during large operations

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- LightRAG API schema changes significantly
- New entity types are added to the system
- Performance issues are reported by users
- CLI usage patterns change significantly

## Detailed Risk Analysis

### TECH-001: CLI Command Argument Validation Gaps

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - CLI commands have basic validation but may miss edge cases
**Impact**: Medium - Invalid arguments could cause confusing error messages

**Description**: The CLI commands for search, list, and show have basic argument validation, but may not handle all edge cases properly, such as special characters in entity names or invalid pagination parameters.

**Affected Components**:
- `src/jestir/cli.py` (search, list, show commands)
- Command line argument parsing

**Mitigation**:
- Add comprehensive input validation for all CLI arguments
- Implement proper error messages for invalid inputs
- Add input sanitization for special characters
- Create unit tests for edge case validation

**Testing Focus**:
- Test with special characters in entity names
- Test with invalid pagination parameters
- Test with empty or malformed queries
- Test with extremely long input strings

### TECH-002: LightRAG API Response Parsing Robustness

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - API responses may vary in format
**Impact**: Medium - Parsing failures could cause command failures

**Description**: The current response parsing in `_parse_search_response` and `_parse_entity_details` methods is basic and may not handle all possible response formats from the LightRAG API, potentially causing parsing errors.

**Affected Components**:
- `src/jestir/services/lightrag_client.py`
- Response parsing methods

**Mitigation**:
- Implement robust JSON parsing with fallback handling
- Add response format validation
- Create comprehensive error handling for parsing failures
- Add logging for parsing issues

**Testing Focus**:
- Test with various API response formats
- Test with malformed JSON responses
- Test with missing required fields
- Test with unexpected data types

### TECH-003: Pagination Edge Case Handling

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Edge cases are rare
**Impact**: Medium - Could cause incorrect results

**Description**: Pagination logic may not handle edge cases properly, such as when the total count changes between requests or when requesting pages beyond available data.

**Affected Components**:
- CLI pagination logic
- LightRAG client pagination

**Mitigation**:
- Add validation for page numbers
- Handle total count changes gracefully
- Implement proper boundary checking
- Add user feedback for pagination issues

**Testing Focus**:
- Test pagination with changing total counts
- Test requesting pages beyond available data
- Test with zero results
- Test with single page results

### PERF-001: Large Result Set Performance Degradation

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Large datasets are common
**Impact**: High - Poor performance affects user experience

**Description**: When dealing with large numbers of entities, the search and list operations may experience performance degradation, especially with pagination and result processing.

**Affected Components**:
- LightRAG API client
- CLI result processing
- Pagination system

**Mitigation**:
- Implement result caching for frequently accessed data

- LightRAG API integration
- Entity data processing
- Result caching

**Mitigation**:
- Implement data validation across operations
- Add consistency checks
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Add data synchronization mechanisms

**Description**: When search or list operations return no results, the user experience may not be clear or helpful, potentially confusing users about what went wrong.

**Affected Components**:
- CLI output formatting
- Error messaging
- User guidance

**Mitigation**:
- Improve empty result messaging
- Add helpful suggestions for failed searches
- Implement better query guidance
- Add examples of successful queries

### OPS-001: Error Message Clarity for Troubleshooting

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Error messages are generally clear

- Error handling in CLI commands
- LightRAG client error handling
- User feedback systems

**Mitigation**:
- Improve error message detail and clarity
- Add troubleshooting guidance

## Conclusion

Story 2.3 has a moderate risk profile with no critical risks identified. The main concerns are around performance with large datasets and input validation. The existing implementation is solid with good mock mode support and error handling. With proper testing and minor improvements, this story can be safely deployed.

The risk score of 78/100 indicates a relatively low-risk implementation that should proceed with standard testing and monitoring practices.
