## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

*No critical risks identified for this foundational story.*

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Dependency Vulnerabilities

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Third-party dependencies commonly contain vulnerabilities
**Impact**: High - Could introduce security risks to the entire project
**Mitigation**:

- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Implemented `pip-audit` and `bandit` for security scanning
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: All dependency versions pinned in pyproject.toml
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Set up automated security scanning in pre-commit hooks
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Security commands available: `audit-deps`, `audit-code`, `audit-all`, `security-report`
- **Testing Focus**: Security audit tests, vulnerability scanning

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Category | Title | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|----------|-------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|
| SEC-001 | Security | Dependency vulnerabilities | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High |

| DATA-001 | Data | Configuration file corruption | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| OPS-001 | Operational | Pre-commit hook failures | Medium (2) | Low (1) | 2 | Low |
| OPS-002 | Operational | Git configuration issues | Low (1) | High (3) | 3 | Low |
| TECH-002 | Technical | CLI framework selection | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Minimal |
| PERF-001 | Performance | Dependency bloat | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Minimal |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- **Security Testing**:
  - Run `uv audit` to check for known vulnerabilities
  - Test dependency version pinning
  - Verify no sensitive data in committed files

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- **uv Configuration Testing**:
  - Test uv commands in clean environment
  - Verify dependency resolution works correctly
  - Test project structure imports

### Priority 3: Low/Minimal Risk Tests

- **Standard Functional Tests**:
  - Verify CLI commands work
  - Test pre-commit hooks functionality
  - Validate directory structure

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All high risks (score 6+)
- Security vulnerabilities must be addressed

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with proper documentation
- Low risks with monitoring in place

### Accepted Risks

- CLI framework selection (minimal impact, easily changeable)
- Dependency bloat (minimal performance impact)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Security alerts for dependency vulnerabilities
- Performance metrics for CLI startup time
- Code quality metrics from pre-commit hooks
- Git repository health checks

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New dependencies are added
- Security vulnerabilities are discovered
- CLI framework needs to be changed
- Project structure is modified
- Team development practices change

## Risk Mitigation Details

### SEC-001: Dependency Vulnerabilities

**Mitigation Strategy**: Preventive
**Actions**:
- Implement `uv audit` in CI/CD pipeline
- Pin all dependency versions in pyproject.toml
- Set up automated security scanning
- Establish regular dependency update schedule
- Use dependency vulnerability databases

**Testing Requirements**:
- Security audit tests
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Clean environment testing

**Residual Risk**: Low - Regular monitoring required
**Owner**: Development team
**Timeline**: Before first commit

### TECH-001: uv Configuration Complexity

**Mitigation Strategy**: Preventive
**Actions**:
- Follow uv best practices documentation
- Use standard Python project structure
- Test uv commands in clean environment
- Document configuration decisions

**Testing Requirements**:
- uv configuration validation tests
- Clean environment setup tests
- Dependency resolution tests

**Residual Risk**: Low - Well-documented process
**Owner**: Development team
**Timeline**: During initial setup
