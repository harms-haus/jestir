## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- **TECH-001**: Integration testing between outline and story generation with various length constraints
- **PERF-001**: Performance testing with length validation enabled, measuring token usage impact
- **BUS-001**: User acceptance testing with different length specifications and validation of user satisfaction

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- **TECH-002**: Boundary testing for outline-to-story length consistency
- **TECH-003**: Accuracy testing of reading time calculations across different content types
- **TECH-004**: Edge case testing for length validation (very short/long stories, special characters)

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- **DATA-001**: Context file integrity testing with length metadata
- **OPS-001**: Debugging workflow testing for length control issues

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All high risks (score 6) must have mitigation strategies implemented
- Length constraint integration must be thoroughly tested
- Performance impact must be within acceptable limits

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with comprehensive testing coverage
- User expectation management through clear documentation

### Accepted Risks

- Low operational complexity risk is acceptable with proper monitoring

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Token usage metrics for length validation operations
- User satisfaction scores for length control accuracy
- Performance metrics for outline and story generation with length constraints
- Error rates for length validation failures

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New length control algorithms are implemented
- User feedback indicates length control issues
- Performance degradation is observed
- Integration with other story generation features changes

## Detailed Risk Analysis

### TECH-001: Length Constraint Integration Complexity

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Requires coordination between outline and story generation
**Impact**: High - Could break existing story generation pipeline

**Description**: Integrating length constraints requires modifying both outline generation and story generation stages, with potential for breaking existing functionality.

**Mitigation**:
- Implement length constraints as optional feature with feature flags
- Create comprehensive integration tests covering all length constraint scenarios
- Implement gradual rollout with fallback to original behavior
- Add extensive logging for length constraint operations

**Testing Focus**:
- End-to-end testing with various length specifications
- Regression testing of existing story generation without length constraints
- Integration testing between outline and story generation stages

### PERF-001: Token Usage Increase with Length Validation

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Length validation requires additional LLM calls
**Impact**: Medium - Increased costs and slower generation
