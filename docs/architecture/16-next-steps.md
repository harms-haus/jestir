# Next Steps

## Frontend Architecture Prompt

For future Angular web application: "Create a frontend architecture that wraps the Python CLI as a backend service. Focus on real-time progress updates during generation, visual entity management, and interactive context editing. Maintain the 3-stage pipeline concept with clear UI states for each stage."

## Developer Prompt

"Implement the 3-stage pipeline following this architecture. Start with Story 1.1 (project setup) then Story 1.2 (context generation). Focus on clean separation between components using the Repository pattern for LightRAG. All external services must be mockable for testing. Use Pydantic models for type safety throughout."
