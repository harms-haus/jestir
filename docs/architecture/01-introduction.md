# Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for the Bedtime Story Generator, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
This initial version focuses on the CLI implementation. A future Frontend Architecture Document will detail the Angular web application design when that phase begins.
